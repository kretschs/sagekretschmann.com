With this project I wanted to explore a concept I've been fascinated by for a long time. The
concept, which I call incidental spaces, is rather difficult to concretely define, and, while I have
become better at explaining it recently, it's still largely vibes-based. What I mean when I call a
place "incidental" is that it came into existence not on its own, but as a result of other places
existing. Those places are well thought out points of interest. However, because they have to
have *something* in between them, these incidental places are created. Whether or not these
places are particularly functional doesn't change the fact that they are odd. Because they aren't
meant to be lingered in, when you do slow down and take a look at them, it can feel very
strange. You might start speculating about the history of a location, trying to figure out the order
in which things were built. They can feel a little off-putting or eerie. Incidental spaces can also
be really elusive when you are specifically looking or them, as I was for this project. At first
glance, most of these locations feel entirely unremarkable, or even boring. Only by spending
time there was I able to determine whether they were good examples of this phenomenon.
