With this project my goal was to explore how light can be used to enchance the feeling of an image and create emotion. My approach to this involved going to an interesting location and seeing what I found. The most interesting photos resulted from being in those places at the right time. I still haven't mastered using light in the daytime, and I have limited equipment. I was really happy with the pictures I took later in the day or at night. Because of the time I was shooting, it forced me to get better at low-light photography. I had to think very carefully about light sources visible to the lens due to how long my exposure had to be.
