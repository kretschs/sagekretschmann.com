This project was a great chance to improve my portrait-taking skills. I will not put all of my final pictures up as they contain my family members. 

Before this project, I had very little experience in portraiture. I did want to be sure I captured more than just the subject's appearance. In the pictures on this website, the subject was myself. The first picture is of me making my morning cup of coffee. This is a morning ritual of mine that I find very meditative. The next picture depicts curiosity and my love of both nature and the things we humans build. The last image depicts my playful side. I also made it more abstract to reflect my sometimes abstract sense of humor.

The two most difficult things in this project were lighting and taking the pictures of myself. The fact that some of these were taken in suboptimal lighting conditions forced me to use some creative edits. Taking pictures of myself was hard because I had to use a timer and struggled to get the facial expressions right. I would overthink it and overexaggerate my expressions which led to my face looking uncanny. Eventually, though, I did get the shots I wanted.
