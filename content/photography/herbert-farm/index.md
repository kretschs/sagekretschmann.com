For this project I wanted to explore the results of the ongoing restoration of the Herbert Farm and Natural Area. It's on the edge of town along Mary's river, and you get there on a gravel road. What used to be a ryegrass farm has been restored to a natural state. It feels nearly untouched. There is constant birdsong, it smells wonderful, and I was surprised at the amount of variety in what I saw. As I explored, I managed to find some of the ongoing efforts. As it used to be a farm, the surrounding area is mostly farms as well, which stand in sharp contrast to the native prairies in the natural area.
